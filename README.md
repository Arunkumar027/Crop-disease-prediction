# Description
The Crop Disease Prediction project focuses on using data-driven approaches to identify potential crop diseases based on environmental factors, crop health parameters, and other relevant features. The model utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to classify the type of disease affecting the crops.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes labeled data of crops and their corresponding disease symptoms.
Data contains features like temperature, humidity, crop type, and visible symptoms.
If the dataset is not included in this repository, you may need to download or prepare your own.

# Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following tools and libraries installed:
1. Python 3.8+
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. NumPy
4. Pandas
5. Scikit-learn
6. TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the model used)
7. Matplotlib
8. Seaborn

# Model Overview
The project implements a classification model to identify diseases in crops. It includes:
1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.
2. Model Training: Using machine learning or deep learning algorithms.
3. Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

# Results
1. Model Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of X% during model evaluation (replace with the actual figure).
2. Key Findings:
The model successfully identifies crop diseases with high precision for specific disease types (list disease types if applicable).
Certain features, such as temperature and humidity, had significant importance in the prediction process.
Highlighted areas for improvement, such as handling imbalanced datasets or improving recall for rare disease cases.
